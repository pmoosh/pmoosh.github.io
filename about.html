            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Keeping a blog up-to-date with somewhat relevant content isn’t easy and I promise that at least I try and with this blog I will try harder than ever before :-)
However, the most difficult part for me is the about page. What should I tell others about me?</p>

<p>I have been around in the computer industry for quite a while, but that didn’t make be famous. Nothing will :-)
I did hardware, firmware, then support/development/qa/sysadmin all at once and way too long. That was then, when I was working for a small computer division of a large company. That division is now gone.
Then I did some more QA for a very large computer company and certified database versions of its largest competitor on its proprietary UNIX (“What is AIX?”).
Worked with some really good people there, but the work wasn’t that much fun.</p>

<p>Then I had to change. I looked into big data, but finally realized that DevOps is what I wanted to do. Now that looked like fun. Doing it for about 2 years now and what excites me about it, is that you have to be a lifelong learner - period. Now, I am working with a friend in a small setup helping companies with their DevOps needs. Awesome!!!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learned Ansible - really fun stuff - fixed a few bugs</li>
  <li>Leaned Chef - help to maintain a little utility for knife; meet amazing people; work on great projects</li>
  <li>Got into Docker - still diving deeper into this new architecture universe</li>
  <li>Acquired skills with Cloudformation - it’s json what else is there to say …</li>
  <li>Checking out Terraform now - because - you know Cloudformation</li>
  <li>Did dabble with Elasticsearch. And Logstash. And Kibana. And now Beats</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a few things I was able to work on since I started with DevOps.</p>

<p>And there is one more thing. Back in 2009 I was a bit lost - work wise and in general - so I signed up as an volunteer for the Silicon Valley Code. Not sure why, but it worked out great. Realized I do enjoy organizing these kind of events, which is why I am started co-organizing a bunch of Meetups and now the DevOpsDays Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>Hope this write-up explains a bit who I am.</p>

<p>Have a great Day</p>

<p>Peter</p>
